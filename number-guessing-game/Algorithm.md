# ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game â€“ Algorithm

This algorithm describes the logic for a simple number guessing game, where the user has a limited number of attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a defined range.

---


## ðŸ§® Steps:

1. **Accept Input Range**
   - Prompt the user to enter the lower and upper bounds for the guessing range.

2. **Generate Random Number**
   - Use a random number generator to select a number within the specified bounds (inclusive).
   num=random.randint(low,high)

3. **Calculate Maximum Allowed Guesses**
4. **Start Guessing Loop**
